\item[Project Summary:] Forecasting the impacts of global environmental change is a major challenge facing ecologists and land managers in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. However, the potential to translate our deep understanding of ecological systems into skillful forecasts remains unknown. Emerging theory on partitioning forecast uncertainty provides an opportunity to evaluate the limits to ecological forecasts. We propose to convene a diverse working group of quantitative ecologists, each with detailed knowledge of a particular study system, to develop forecasting models of plant and animal populations. As a team, we will partition the forecast uncertainty for each focal population to test fundamental hypotheses about the relationship between particular sources of uncertainty and population characteristics. We will develop a forecast repository and a synthetic database of population time series coupled with environmental covariates that will be ideal for teaching and research. We anticipate our work will (1) catalyze a new research agenda for ecology focused on identifying the boundaries of ecological forecasts and (2) immediately inform ongoing efforts to monitor, model, and predict ecological dynamics.

A fundamental challenge facing society is to predict the ecological impacts of global environmental changes such as nitrogen deposition, climate change, and habitat fragmentation.
Each of these global change drivers have now exceeded their historical ranges of variability [@Steffen2015], ushering in a no-analog era in which the past cannot predict the future.
We can, however, look to the past to parameterize models that allow us to *forecast* the future states of ecological systems [@Clark2001; @Dietze2018].
Ecologists are in an excellent position to meet this forecasting challenge because we have spent decades gaining understanding of the processes that regulate populations, communities, and ecosystems.
However, we lack a systematic understanding of the current limits to ecological forecasts.
As a result, we do not know how to allocate research effort to improve our forecasts.

Making poor forecasts is inevitable as ecology matures into a more predictive science.
The key is to learn from our failures so that forecasts become more accurate over time.
The success of meteorological forecasting tells us that basic research on the causes of forecast uncertainty is an essential component of this learning process [@Bauer2015].
<!-- In ecology, we can accelerate this process by combining our knowledge of diverse organisms and processes with emerging knowledge on forecast uncertainty [@Petchey2015].  -->


@Dietze2017a proposed a first-principles approach to partitioning forecast uncertainty.
Consider a dynamical model designed to predict some state *y* in the future ($y_{t+1}$) based on the current state ($y_{t}$), an environmental driver(s) ($x$), parameters ($\theta$), and process error ($\epsilon$).
We can then write a general form of the model as:
\vspace{-3em}
\begin{align}
y_{t+1} = f(y_t, x_t|\theta) + \epsilon,
\end{align}
\vspace{-0.5em}
which states that $y$ at time $t+1$ is a function of $y$ and $x$ at time $t$ conditional on the model parameters ($\theta$) plus process error ($\epsilon$).
@Dietze2017a showed that forecast variance ($Var[y_{t+1}]$) is:
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{align}
Var[y_{t+1}] = \underbrace{\left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2}_{\text{stability}} 
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 } Var[y_t]}_{\text{IC uncert.}} +
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 }\left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta x} \right)^2}_{\text{driver sens.}} 
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 } Var[x_t]}_{\text{driver uncert.}} +
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 }\left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta \theta} \right)^2}_{\text{param sens.}}
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 } Var[\theta]}_{\text{param. uncert.}} +
               \underbrace{\vphantom{ \left(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y} \right)^2 } Var[\epsilon]}_{\text{process error}},
\end{align}

where each additive term follows a pattern of *sensitivity* times *variance* ("IC uncert." refers to "*I*nitial *C*onditions uncertainty").
The variance attributable to any particular factor is a function of how sensitive the model is to the factor and the variance of that factor.
For example, the atmosphere is a chaotic system, meaning its dynamics are internally unstable and sensitive to initial conditions uncertainty.
This is why billions of dollars are spent each year to measure meterological variables -- meterologists learned that the key to reducing forecast error $(Var[y_{t+1}])$ was to reduce the uncertainty of initial conditions ($Var[y_t]$).

In contrast, ecologists are attempting to make actionable forecasts with little knowledge of which term in Eq. 2 dominates forecast error.
Knowing which term dominates forecast error in different ecological settings will advance our fundamental understanding of the natural world and immediately impact practical efforts to monitor, model, and predict ecological dynamics.
While it is impossible to partition forecast uncertainty for every species on Earth, links among the dominant source of forecast error and species' life histories might serve as prior information that can guide new monitoring and modeling efforts.

\textbf{\emph{The goal of this project is to synthesize forecasts of plant and animal populations to advance our fundamental knowledge of the current limits to ecological forecasts}}.
We will convene a diverse group of population ecologists to partition forecast uncertainty for several species and systematically link sources of uncertainty to characteristics of the focal populations (e.g., life history traits).
Doing so will (1) quantify the current limits to ecological forecasts, (2) create a bridge between ecological theory and ecological forecasts, and (3) provide actionable information on new ways to improve ongoing ecological forecasts.

\section{Hypotheses}
All forecasts are uncertain, and reducing forecast uncertainty hinges upon knowing the source of uncertainty.
The premise of this proposal is that ecological characteristics of organisms (e.g., life history) are related to sources of forecast uncertainty.
Specifically, we pose three hypotheses motivated by recent reviews of ecological forecasting [@Petchey2015; @Houlahan2017].

\begin{description}

\item[H1.] \textbf{The contribution of initial conditions uncertainty to forecast uncertainty is greater for fast growing populations than for slow growing populations.} Fast growing populations are more likely to exhibit chaotic or near-chaotic dynamics, which inflate forecast uncertainty due to initial conditions uncertainty. To test this hypothesis we will regress the proportion of uncertainty attributable to initial conditions against estimated intrinsic population growth rates.

\item[H2.] \textbf{The contribution of driver uncertainty to forecast uncertainty is greater for species that ``predict'' than for species that ``bet-hedge'' against environmental conditions.} In variable environments, annual plants have developed two strategies for maintaining fitness despite changing conditions: (i) bet-hedging, where germination is low but constant, and (ii) predictive germination, where germination rates, cued by the environment, vary substantially from year to year. Bet-hedgers should be insensitive to environmental drivers, and thus to driver uncertainty. We will compare forecast partitions for winter annual plants that span a spectrum from bet-hedgers to predictors (Gremer et al. 2014) to test this hypothesis. To apply this approach to our other focal data sets, we will quantify interannual variation of vital rates to determine where species lie on the bet-hedging spectrum (e.g., Botero et al. 2015).

\item[H3.] \textbf{The contribution of process uncertainty to forecast uncertainty increases with the number of trophic links.} We are using single-species population models in which trophic interactions are implicit, not explicit. If trophic interactions are important our models will poorly represent the process. We will compare forecast partitions for all data sets to test this hypothesis. Our working group will consist of experts for each data set (Tables 1 and 2), enabling us to develop food webs for each focal species based on expert knowledge. 

\end{description}

Testing our hypotheses requires applying a standardized analytical approach to a synthetic data set representative of many species – an activity that can only be done at the Powell Center as a working group. 
<!-- These three hypotheses are just a starting point, as the working group will generate additional hypotheses. -->

\section{Proposed Activities}
PIs Tredennick, Hooten, and Adler have led several efforts to forecast the response of plant populations to climate change [@Tredennick2016Ecos; @Tredennick2017a].
Our frustration with the high levels of uncertainty in our forecasts, and our inability to attribute that uncertainty to specific causes, has motivated this proposal.
We seek to (1) assemble a database of publicly available time series of plant and animal abundances which contain the necessary data, (2) use those data to fit forecasting models, and (3) partition the forecast uncertainty from those models to better understand the limits to ecological forecasting.
We have learned that collating large data sets and rigorously fitting statistical population models requires dedicated effort.
We therefore request funding for a Powell Fellow (to be recruited) to lead the proposed work.

\subsection{Data Synthesis}
We have identified 12 potential data sets (Table 1) and our working group members (Table 2) may identify more based on their professional networks.
All abundance data sets will be combined into a single database that can be queried using standard SQL software. 
The abundance data will be linked to a second database of environmental covariates. 
We will extract climate data as needed from gridded data products (e.g., PRISM). 
We will work with study area experts (Table 2) to decide on appropriate climate covariates for each time series.
<!-- NEXT SENTENCES COULD BE CUT -->
<!-- One of our first tasks as a working group will be to develop a set of criteria for selecting data. -->
<!-- These criteria will include cut-offs for length of time series, availability of suitable climate and other environmental data, and the number of replicate observations within a time period. -->
<!-- Our goal is to assemble a database with equal representation of plant and animal species. -->

\subsection{Analysis}
\subsubsection{Dynamic Forecasting Models}
Using the assembled time series, we will fit Bayesian hierarchical state-space models, which are well-suited for ecological forecasting because they incorporate and propagate the uncertainties we seek to partition: process uncertainty, observation uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty.
State-space models also explicitly acknowledge that our observations are imperfect, meaning that the state we want to estimate (e.g., abundance of bison in Yellowston) is unknowable, or *latent*.
A typical state-space model takes the form:
\vspace{-1.5em}
\begin{align}
y_t &\sim \text{Normal}(z_t, \sigma^2_{\text{o}}), \\
z_t &\sim \text{Normal}\left(f(\boldsymbol{\theta},z_{t-1},\bold{x}_t), \sigma^2_{\text{p}}\right),
\end{align}

\begin{wrapfigure}[31]{tr}{0.45\textwidth}
  \centering
     \includegraphics[height=4in]{../figures/bison_combined.png}
  \caption{An example state space model fit and forecast (A) and example of forecast uncertainty partitioning (B). In (A), points are observed counts and error bars show the observed standard deviation; solid line is the median of the posterior distribution of the number of bison in Yellowstone and shaded area shows the 95\% Bayesian Credible Interval. Within-sample estimates are constrained by data, whereas the forecasts (past 2010) are not. Panel (B) shows the relative contribution of each source of forecast uncertainty over time.}
\end{wrapfigure}

where $y_t$ is the observed state at time *t*, $z_t$ is the latent state at time *t*, $\mu_t$ is the determinstic prediction of the state at time *t* given estimated parameters ($\boldsymbol{\theta}$) for the specified model function [*f()*], the latent state *z* at time *t*-1, and $\textbf{x}_t$ is a vector of environmental covariates.
The two error terms represent observation error ($\sigma^2_{\text{o}}$) and process error ($\sigma^2_{\text{p}}$).
The model is *dynamic* because the future state ($z_t$) depends on the previous state ($z_{t-1}$).
We show the data and process models (Eqs. 3 and 4, respectively) with normal likelihoods, but the distribution of the data model will vary depending on the particular data generating process [@Hobbs2015].
Using different distributions for the data and process models also helps make variance parameters identifiable when replicate observations are not available [@Hobbs2015], thus avoiding a potential pitfall of state-space models [@Auger-Methe2016].

\subsubsection{An Example: Yellowstone Bison}
We used annual counts of the Yellowston bison from 1975 to 2010 to fit a population growth model using a state-space approach.
After fitting the model, we made annual forecasts for 7 years into the future with all uncertainty propagated (Fig. 1A).
We made those same forecasts with (*i*) just initial condition uncertainty; (*ii*) initial condition and parameter uncertainty; (*iii*) initial condition, parameter, and driver uncertainty; and (*iv*) initial condition, parameter, driver, and process uncertainty.
This set of forecasts allows us to partition the relative uncertainty from different sources, taking a numerical approach that is analagous to the analytical approach shown in Equation 2.

The key result is that parameter uncertainty dominates forecast uncertainty at all horizons, with a shift toward driver and process error at later horizons (Fig. 1B).
Initial condition uncertainty decays very quickly, indicating strong internal population regulation and the lack of chaotic dynamics, which is consistent with our **Hypothesis H1**.
A rigorous test of **H1** will require comparison with results from fast-growing populations.

\section{Participants}
Our working group contains both gender and career stage diversity (Table 2).
Of the 14 listed participants, five are women and six are early career scientists.
Several participants bring expert knowledge of a particular dataset, some bring analytical experitise, and many bring both.
Participants will break into analysis teams, each responsible for two or three datasets.
Analysis teams will work together duing the meetings at the Powell Center to develop a modeling framework for their datasets, which will be presented back to the larger group for discussion.
The Powell Fellow will be responsible for implementing the modeling approach, with significant contributions from analysis teams.
<!-- At the second meeting, analysis teams will present results, at which point the entire group will work together to trouble-shoot lingering problems. THIS OVERLAPS WITH THE TIMELINE -->

\section{Anticipated Results and Benefits}
Ecological forecasts are central to ecosystem mangament, either explicitly or implicitly.
\textbf{\emph{Understanding the sources of forecast error will provide actionable information that can guide management decisions by focusing data collection and model improvement efforts on areas that will most reduce forecast uncertainty}} (Box 1).
Another benefit of this project will be the conceptual advance of linking ecological theory to sources of forecast uncertainty.
We anticipate that research associated with this project will catalyze a new area of research on ecological forecasting.
The working group participants will gain experience using cutting-edge quantitative techniques.
The assembled database of plant and animal abundance time series, coupled with environmental covariates, will be a valuable resource for teaching and research, and the repository of population forecasts will provide new opportunities to validate, and improve, forecasts.
<!-- No repository of ecological forecasts currently exists, but one of our participants (M. Dietze) plans to develop one as part of the NSF-funded *Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative*. -->
<!-- Our working group and his project will work synergistically to create a repository. -->
In addition, we expect to produce several publications, including:

1. A synthesis paper testing our hypotheses using all the data sets aimed at *PNAS* or *Ecology Letters*.
2. A forum-style paper on the current limits to ecological forecasting, how to overcome them, and the usefulness of even uncertain forecasts for ecosystem management for *Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment*.
3. Several in-depth papers on forecasts of specific populations aimed at top-tier applied journals such as *Ecological Applications* and *Journal of Applied Ecology*.

  \footnotesize
  \begin{description}
  \item[Inform priors] Linking forecast uncertainty to species' ecologies can allow researchers to use informed priors in Bayesian forecasting models, which can reduce parameter and process uncertainty.
  \item[Synergy] Contributes a large number of new case studies to ongoing efforts to assess the common patterns to ecological predictability across different processes and systems (e.g., the \emph{Near-term ecological forecasting initiative}).
  \item[Research and Development] Knowing the sources of uncertainty will allow us to determine whether more data, more precise data, or different modeling approaches will be most effective for improving our forecasts. It also lets us use scarce monitoring resources more efficiently by focusing efforts on where we will get the greatest return on investment in terms of reducing uncertainties in our predictions
  \item[Ecosystem Management] This working group will help improve existing population forecasts, which would immediately feed into advice to the management community.
