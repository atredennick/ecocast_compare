# This script takes data input from two different users in two sheets of an excel 
# workbook and prints a list of rows that are not identical, for review by the user.
# Output is a data frame of row and column of a mismatch.

# Notes: - row order matters, i.e. data sheets must be entered in same order
#        - worksheets to be compared must be the first two worksheets in the workbook
#        - name of worksheets does not matter
#        - prints "worksheets identical" if two worksheets are identical
