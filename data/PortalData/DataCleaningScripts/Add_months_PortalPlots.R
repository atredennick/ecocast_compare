### Code to take the original Portal_plots.csv which only reported plot treatment by year
### And add in what month is was in what treatment
### This allows us to more finely control summarizing the Portal data
### by being able assign exactly when a plot changed treatment
### Info for what month a treatment changed was obtained from:
